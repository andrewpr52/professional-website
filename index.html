			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Truman State University. I also studied abroad at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia
			during my Spring 2017 semester. I have taken courses in web development, databases, programming languages, object oriented programming/design, and others.</p>
			<p>My passion for technology extends back to a young age, but my passion for computer science goes back to my senior year in high school, where I took an introduction
			computer science course and decided then that I wanted to do this as a career.</p>
			<p>There are many different areas that computer science branches off into, and I have recently found that I have really enjoyed the areas that include some aspect of UI
			design, such as web development, mobile application development, etc. Thatâ€™s what this site is for; to showcase some of the things that I have created.</p>
			<p>If you would like to know more about me or my experience, feel free to contact me right away!</p>

			<h2>Websites</h2>
			<p>This website: Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.arodsg.com" target="_blank">arodSG.com</a>: Another personal website of mine, based around my YouTube channel. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
			<p><a href="" target=" ">Psst!</a>: This was for a project that I had in my Web Development class while I was studying abroad in Australia.
			We had to design a Twitter-like website which was fully functional and allowed for different users to login, create new posts, search for specific users or hashtags,
			view a specific user's posts, etc. Created using HTML, CSS, Python, and SQLite.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>Application Designs</h2>
			<p>All application designs, including all assets used within the designs, were created by me using Photoshop.</p>
